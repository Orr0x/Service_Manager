# Competitive Landscape Analysis: Service Mesh B2B SaaS

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Analyst:** Mary - Business Analyst
**Date:** December 4, 2025

## Executive Summary

The Field Service Management (FSM) market is characterized by fragmented solutions focused on internal workforce management. Our analysis of 27 major competitors reveals a critical gap: none offer true B2B service orchestration capabilities. This creates a unique positioning opportunity for our Service Mesh platform.

While incumbents have strong brand recognition and customer bases, they're constrained by legacy architectures that weren't designed for cross-tenant data sharing. Our technical advantage creates a defensible market position.
